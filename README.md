### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a highschool student, currently a beginner in the world of programming.
I'm learning how to program some pretty small projects like calculators, hang-man, and small games.
Collaboration is pretty new to me and ngl I'm pretty scared to meet new people and talk with those who know much MUCH more about the concept than me. 
However I am always open to criticism and help cuz im a very nice guy and nice person. Also very silly and goofy.
Stuff I like include video games like ULTRAKILL, movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel. And cartoons and other stuff like FLCL.
